            <h3>GPU-Accelerated Active Nematic Simulations </h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;">Theoretical collaboration with John Hopkins University</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                  <li> Systems of living organisms are typically active. That is, energy is consistently injected into the system through the conversion of chemical energy from 
                        injested food to mechanical energy. Due to these constant energy transformations, active systems are out of thermodynamic equilibrium. Interestingly, the 
                        the non-equilibrium state allows active systems to exhibit complex behaviors: it allows the systems to self-organize into structures that would not 
                        be permitted for a system at equilibrium. </li>
                  <li> Nematic systems comprises of elongated entities whose assembly have a long-ranged
                        orientational order but no long-ranged translational order. This is another way of saying the entities have a preferred direction of alignment but lack 
                        a regular arrangement in space. </li>
                  <li> An active nematic system, therefore, would be a colony or sheet of living rod-shaped bacteria, for example. But, what mechanisms are at work in these systems?
                        To answer this question, we theoretically model these sytems using an open source tool: 
                        <a href="https://github.com/sussmanLab/open-Qmin/tree/master">Open-Qmin</a>.</li>
                  <li> My work on this aspect has focused on parallelizing the computation, using CUDA, for the 2D implementation of the agent-based modeling of these 
                        systems in <a href="https://github.com/sussmanLab/open-Qmin/tree/master">Open-Qmin</a> and optimzing the workflow to support deep learning models. We focus on how these systems, in 2D, interact with boundaries.
                        Imagine an aerial view of a herd of sheep, or a sheet of rod-shaped bacteria, navigating the obstacles in a small enclosure.</li>

            <h3>Machine Learning Structure-Dynamic Correlation in Supercooled Liquids</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 0;"> Independent computational study </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li> If a system is cooled fast enough that crystalization is avoided at the freezing temperature, the system becomes a supercooled liquid.
                    The system constituents do not have regular arrangements in space - they preserve the continuous translational symmetry in space like you see in ordinary liquids - yet, the
                     supercooled liquid is rigid like crystalline solids.</li>
                <li>In crytalline solids, it is relatively easy to predict failure sites. Particle rearrangements, which are precursors to material failure, are concentrated around
                    sites in which there is a deviation in the regular arrangements of the particles.</li>
                <li>Due to the lack of regularity in the structure of particles in supercooled liquids, predicting failure sites in such a system is not trivial. Thus, the application of
                    machine learning models in predicting dynamics (i.e. particle rearrangements) from local structure in supercooled liquids.</li>
                <li>My work in this project centered on implementing transformer-based neural networks, graph neural networks and a couple of traditional machine learning 
                    models in a supervised learning approach to investigate the correlation between structure and dynamics, and a common physical interpretation from the models.
                    The workflow was optimized to process large-scale datasets through C-Python pipelines.</li>

            <h3>Transfer Learning for predicting glassy dynamics from fluid structure</h3>
            <p>Computational study at Emory University</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>To predict particle rearrangement from structure in supercooled liquids, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3644">study</a> used a Support Vector Classification (SVC) approach
                to identify the energy cost required for rearrangement in a local structure.</li>
                <li>This methodology, which gives important physical insight, however, requires balanced labeled dataset on the scale of ten thousands for training.
                    These datasets are derived from deep in the supercooled phase and is computationally costly to attain.</li>
                <li> In this project, my work centered on building a support vector classifier from balanced labeled dataset derived from the liquid pahse, which 
                    is easily accessible computationally. We showed that this classifier predicts the same energy cost to rearrangements for the same local structure
                    when compared with the classifier derived from balanced labeled dataset derived fromt he supercooled phase. This resulted in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.043112">publication
